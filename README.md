# Heart_Failure_Prediction

This repository features a machine learning initiative focused on forecasting heart failure through the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The project leverages medical datasets to discern patterns and assess the probability of heart failure by analyzing a range of health metrics.

# Dataset
This model is built on a publically available dataset on heart failure prediction

# Results 
This ANN Achieves an overall val_accuracy of 81.29 % after being trained over 1000 epochs. 
The model contains outputs with graphical representation of training loss vs validation loss, training accuracy vs validation accuracy, also a confusion matrix.

# Contributions are welcomed!
